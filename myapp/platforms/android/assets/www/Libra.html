<font style="font-size: 30px;"><p>Your sign is represented by scales. It must get awful tiresome carrying around those scales and feeling compelled to weigh and measure everything. Being fair and upholding justice are noble principles, but it can be hard to be so perfect in daily life. You may have carried a big burden in this regard throughout 2016, Libra, but the time is coming when you will finally be able to put that burden down. Many people in your life have turned to you over the last year to mediate, to help them make important decisions, and to figure out what is fair and what is not. You have also had your own share of personal issues to deal with. You have been the steady voice of reason, but, unsurprisingly enough, it has taken a toll on you. This year, even from the very beginning, you will feel lighter and freer. There won't be as many requests for your judgment and your time, and you will begin to get a taste of what it's like to feel carefree. Even so, Libra, you may have to recognize that you have always given too much of yourself over to others, and you know this is something that has to change. You will have chances to put this new philosophy into practice, and you will be rewarded with more time to pour into your most important goals. Stand strong on your new way of dealing with this issue in the year ahead, and you'll become more of an advocate for yourself in time.</p></font>
<h1><b><font style="font-size: 40px">Love</font></b></h1>
<font style="font-size: 30px;"><p>The past twelve months may have been a crazy mixture of highs and lows in your love life, Libra. You may have traveled from the depths of despair to the heights of passion, then up and down again. You most likely ended 2016 on a high note, with peace and harmony in any love relationships. Now, as you are entering a new year, you will see it is ripe with new possibilities for your romantic life. If you can think back and identify what preceded the highs and lows in your love life last year, you will be able to recognize how to avoid certain pitfalls, and how to make the most of the chances you will have for closeness, warmth and passion in the future. Single Libras will probably have quite a lot of fun meeting a number of eligible romantic prospects - especially in the first part of 2017. But you may not be as interested in passionate flings as you are in meeting someone you can really trust and care for ï¹˜ someone who'd care as much for you as well. That is a possibility this year, but probably not until later in the year. Those who already have a significant other - especially those Libras who are married - should experience a very social year with your lover that will allow you to spend a lot of time "dating" and recapturing the excitement you had in the beginning of your relationship.</p></font>

<h1><b><font style="font-size: 40px">Family</font></b></h1>
<font style="font-size: 30px;"><p>You hopefully broke through a gridlock in one or more family relationships in 2016, Libra. There was a lot of work to do to get back on track with family matters. There may have been some jealousy and resentment to deal with, but you had the grace and caring nature to gently lead the way to make things better. In the year ahead, you will reap the rewards of your efforts, and you will enjoy an unprecedented closeness with even the most difficult members of your family. That's not to say that you won't occasionally hit a speed bump, and then you will have to go back and repave the road you already traveled. But once you experience that once or twice everything will even out and become easier. Pay extra attention to a family member who is out of sorts and behaving out of character. This person may need special support and guidance from you, but if you show your love and caring by checking in with this person and coming with suggestions to motivate and inspire your loved one, the issue will become more and more manageable until it disappears. A family reunion or a gathering of a group of family members who have not seen each other in ages will be possible this year, and it will seem like you've gone back in time. You will recapture memories that you cherished, and it will feel like a fresh start. Towards the end of the year, due to prevailing circumstances, you may not be able to fulfill some of the promises you made. Your loved ones will have a tough time forgiving that, therefore carefully weigh your promises and only promise things you are certain you can fulfill.</p></font>

<h1><b><font style="font-size: 40px">Career</font></b></h1>
<font style="font-size: 30px;"><p>You have always had the potential to be a mover and a shaker, Libra, because you possess a very rare blend of wisdom, objectivity, fairness, foresight, and innovative thinking. In 2016 you may have had many challenging lessons to learn, but they were good practice for some of the opportunities you will face in 2017. You may have encountered more than your fair share of disappointments and difficult people, but you generally handled yourself quite gracefully and morally. And you were noticed, Libra, by people who you will cross paths with again in the year ahead. Some of these people are quite powerful and have the ability to turn the key on some of your dreams, and you will be ready, willing, and able to reach for the stars. Toward the end of last year, you may have noticed a sudden change in tone. All of a sudden you felt more electrically inspired and involved in projects that were of a higher caliber. You will find that beginning in February your opportunities will begin to be increasingly exciting and rewarding. Anything you do now will seem to be blessed and luck will be on your side. If you work hard enough through the first half of the year, you will start seeing results long before the year ends, and you'll be sailing towards even greater success, with the steady wind in your sails. </p></font>
