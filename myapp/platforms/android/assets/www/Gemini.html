<font style="font-size: 30px;"><p>People who don't understand you may see you as having diverse personalities because you are a person of many moods and because you always seem to be going in many different directions. Actually, Gemini, you have many facets to your one big personality, and your broad focus allows you to understand all the nuances of any situation. You can talk easily to people from all walks of life, and you can understand and empathize with them. This means that you have all kinds of friends, and that you have a wide range of dissimilar interests. You have hopefully experienced a wealth of good experiences over the last year, Gemini, and you may chalk it up to good luck. But in reality, you earned every one of your blessings through discipline, hard work, and of course your empathy and kindness. You are someone who sticks by the friends who stick by you, and you should have a strong foundation of friendship in your life. If you don't have it, the year ahead will be an excellent time to expand your network of friends. A spiritual quest you may have begun last year will carry into this year, and you will learn quite a lot about yourself in the process. Any success you enjoyed in the past, and the success you will surely enjoy in the year ahead, will be magnified by a greater sense of self than you have ever had before.</p></font>

<h1><b><font style="font-size: 40px">Love</font></b></h1>
<font style="font-size: 30px;"><p>If you have a nemesis when it comes to your love life, Gemini, it is your multi-faceted personality and the difficulty you sometimes have in staying focused. This may be a recurring theme in your life, with romantic partners who just don't understand your big personality. You have a hyperactive imagination and a strong sense of ambition, and this often causes you to shift your attention from one thing to another. Naturally, a romantic partner who wants your full attention is going to feel as though they're competing with a plethora of other interests you have. This year, Gemini, you should work on staying focused on and nurturing your love life. If there is someone special in your life, set aside some time on a regular basis to express how you feel about that person, and to spend time together in a setting where you can concentrate solely on each other. This alone will enhance your romance and keep the fire burning. In February, you will have a chance to meet someone very special, or to grow closer to someone you already know and love. Times like this are gifts from the universe, and you can't waste them. Make sure you take each opportunity in the year ahead to strengthen your love life, and your efforts will repay you with a closer bond that will keep you warm and fulfilled.</p></font>

<h1><b><font style="font-size: 40px">Family</font></b></h1>
<font style="font-size: 30px;"><p>Your family life may have been pretty predictable over the last year, and the strength of your bonds with family members has probably been pretty solid. Old wounds had a chance to heal, and disjointed relationships grew closer. There may still be one family member who just can't seem to get with the program, but this may not affect you directly. Even so, the effect this conflict has with other members of your family could be upsetting to you. You will need to recognize that you can't control everything, and just allow the situation to evolve on its own. There could be a few family-related surprises in store for you this year, Gemini, and most of them will be delightful. This may mean an unexpected new member of the family - either a baby or a marriage that seemed to come out of the blue. If you accept any surprises with grace and support of the individuals involved, then you will be able to share the happy moments. Try not to be judgmental even with situations that you find bothersome, and over time you may come to see why your support makes good sense. Most of all, you need to continue to nurture the family bonds that have been fragile in the past, because these people are the ones you will turn to in times of stress or crisis, but also in times of joy.</p></font>

<h1><b><font style="font-size: 40px">Career</font></b></h1>
<font style="font-size: 30px;"><p>Your energy may have been very scattered over the past year as you learned about new possibilities for your career, and as you came to know more about what's most important to you. You should have a strong sense of where you want to go with your work now, and that is the foundation for a strong start with a new endeavor. You have big plans and big dreams, and this is the year when you can finally get started in earnest. It may not be obvious to you yet, Gemini, but you have become quite knowledgeable in specific areas of your career. This has come about over a long period of time, but you have accumulated so much experience that you are now someone that others can turn to for advice and guidance. Even so, there may be a new mentor entering your life, who can do the same for you. This person could serve as a gateway to a new opportunity around midyear, when you may have to make a choice about your direction. This could mean giving up something you have been working on in favor of branching out in a different but promising direction. When you arrive at this crossroad, you will know instinctively which way to go. You should enjoy a new and exciting level of success in 2017, which you certainly earned. </p></font>
